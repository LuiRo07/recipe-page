### What I learned

I learned how to style bullet points from an ordered list. I also learnt about how to position elements using CSS Grid. I also learnt to add spacing between bullet points and the text within <ul> or <ol> elements.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
/* spacing for list items*/
.preparation-item {
    margin-left: 1.5em;
}

/* Bullet point color styling */
.step-process li::marker {
    color: var(--primary-nutmeg);
    font-weight: 700;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue to work on making applications more responsive, and with more features. I will also continue to improve project planning to start with a mobile-first approach and improve my workflow for faster development.
